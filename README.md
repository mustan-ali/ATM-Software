This program is a banking system that requires users to enter a PIN to access their account. Once the correct PIN is entered, users can perform various actions. They can check their account balance, deposit money, withdraw money, transfer money to another account, and pay bills. The program validates inputs and provides prompts for users to continue or exit after each action.
